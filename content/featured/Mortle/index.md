The platform helps people manage & share events, messages, belongings and their preferences of how things should happen after they die with their friends and relatives. The only thing I would add is that during the process we hope that people will also face their own mortality so that they can begin to really live the life they should be.

> Megham is a very talented developer, with great attention to detail. He met all proposed milestones, and was very responsive towards changes that were proposed throughout the project, often pushing up changes to address these within minutes. We won't be hesitating to reach out to Megham to take on more work for us in the future!
