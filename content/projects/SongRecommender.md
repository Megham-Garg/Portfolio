- This is a website that I made when I was working as an intern in Oceana Tech.
- Recommendation system that uses item to item based collabrative filtering, co-occourence matrix..
- Reads data from [turi](https://static.turi.com/datasets/millionsong/10000.txt) and [CSV](https://static.turi.com/datasets/millionsong/song_data.csv).
- I've tested this code to recommend from a dataset of one million song.
