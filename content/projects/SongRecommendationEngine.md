- Recommendation system that uses item to item based collabrative filtering. Here i am reading sample data from [turi](https://static.turi.com/datasets/millionsong/10000.txt) and [CSV](https://static.turi.com/datasets/millionsong/song_data.csv). I am testing this code for song recommendation for a million song dataset. I have written a separate module named Recommenders.py for recommendation algorithm that uses co-occourence matrix and imported that module in the file.
